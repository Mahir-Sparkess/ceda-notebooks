    "- Embed visualisations within your code to demonstrate what it does\n",

    "\n",
    " 1. It uses your JASMIN \"login\" account:\n",
    "   - your `$HOME` directory is the same as an SSH terminal session on JASMIN.\n",
    " 2. You can read the CEDA archive directly:\n",
    "   - `/badc/` and `/neodc` are visible\n",
    "   - you can view the same data sets as you can via an SSH session\n",
    " 3. You can read from Group Workspaces:\n",
    "   - your Notebook can see all Group Workspaces that your JASMIN account has access to\n",
    " 4. The common JASMIN software is available:\n",
    "   - the \"jaspy\" packages are installed in the Python3.7 environment\n",
    "     - see: https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/article/4729-jaspy-envs\n",
    " 5. You can install additional packages to extend your Notebook environments"
